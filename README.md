# Hi, I'm Jake! 👋

I'm just a programmer trying to make a home for myself on the WWW.

Some things I've written:

- [An Interactive Intro to CRDTs](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/)
- [Were React Hooks a Mistake?](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/were-react-hooks-a-mistake/)
- [No One Ever Got Fired for Choosing React](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/)

Some things I've built:

- 🏛️ [**jake.museum**](https://jake.museum) — a gallery of every website I've ever made
- 🎥 [**SongRender**](https://songrender.com) — a generative music video creator
